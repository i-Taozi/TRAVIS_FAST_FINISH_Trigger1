Thank you for taking your time to contribute back to this Open Source project.

## Code style

When submitting pull requests and patches, make sure to turn auto formatting and
style off in your IDE.

If your pull request includes changes such as Javadoc changes, tab to space conversion
and similar changes, it makes it much harder to merge your code. Not only due to
different formatting, but there may be other developers working on the code, or other
pending pull requests that may conflict with your changes.

When submitting pull requests, remember that the smaller your change, the simpler
(and faster) it is to get it merged. And you can submit other changes just for code
style and formatting.

## Licensing

Your should be able to license your code under the MIT License, or compatible
license.
